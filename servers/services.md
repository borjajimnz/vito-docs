# Services

Here you can see the list of services that Vito installed on your server.

![Services](/servers/services.png)

You can do operational tasks on the services such as `Start`, `Stop` and `Restart`

## PHPMyAdmin

You can also install PHPMyAdmin if you've installed Mysql on your server.

In the services page you can find the `Install Service` dropdown and under that you can hit the `PHPMyAdmin` to install it.

To install PHPMyAdmin you need to provide the `Allowed IP` and `Port`.

The `Allowed IP` will enable the PHPMyAdmin to be accessible only via that IP address.

Vito will install the PHPMyAdmin on the `Port` you provide in the installation form.

So after the installation, PHPMyAdmin will be availble on `Your-Server-IP:Port`.

The default Port is `5433`.
